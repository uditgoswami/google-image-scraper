# google-image-scraper
scraper in python using selenium to download all the images appearing in google image search
The code uses selenium to intiate a session in chrome or firefox. Phantom.js can also be used.

The code will take an image as input and search google for similar images. It will then download all the images related to the same,

The other code takes string as an input and does the same.

If anyone has a solution for inputting a list of images, i will be really thankful if you choose to share.
